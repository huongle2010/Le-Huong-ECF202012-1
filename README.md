**Evaluation Project**


 **Object**

 Create a website that provides users with a music experience based on customer requirements using HTML3, CSS5 and Javascript (if possible).

 **Description of action**

***Action 1:*** 
Create two pages with HTML and CSS

I will create two pages. Each page will be performed with different version: desktop, mobile et tablet. The structure of each page will be based on the model that is given by the customers and I will change the design (for example color, background, font-size…). Each page has the same general structure including: header, footer, graphic atmosphere. Two pages will be linked together

*Page 1 – Home: * 

This page includes 

- Header: name of site that is given by customer (My Music) on the left and two navigation links that allow to access directly to 2 pages on the right.

- Main part:


The title “Les artistes” is located on the top of the main part and on the center of the row.

5 images that will be arranged in a row

Information of my search of artists is shown on the left blog of main part with the width 20%. On the right of main part (80%): 4 images of artistes + two search blog (by name et by group) + 4 buttons that linked to others websites for listening music.

Footer includes the navigation links that access to other information such as contact, support… I will keep the same footer that is given by customer. 

*Page 2 – My artists* includes:

- Header and footer are same as the page 1
- On the left of main part, each line includes one image of artist and their clip
- On the right of main part: A biographical excerpt of the selected artist, with an insert showing his upcoming concert
dates.

**Action 2: Add features**

- Making the slide of images
- Contact form

**Action 3: Do with Javascript**

Integrate an information flow using JSON to change the content in HTML


**Performance**

**Day 1 **:

I read carefully the instruction of the customer and noticed the important things. For example, which parts of site must be kept et which parts of site should be changed
I did the mock-up of two page with different versions on the Figma. I searched and chose the images of artists and their information by google. I also selected the background image for both of pages et website theme color.

Here the link of maquette:

**Day 2**

I create the folders:  folder of image, folder of CSS, folder of scripts and the files: text.html, mesArtistes.html, style.css and Readme.md. Then I push all folders and file on the Github. 

I finished the first version (v1) of model for both of pages and for desktop, mobile and tablet. I started to think about the structure and the organization of HTML and CSS

Explaining HTML and CSS
- On the header: I have a class “name” and a list (ul) including two navigation links (a). On the footer: there is 5 links.
- I displayed flex box for arrange the links in one row on the header, footer and also for arrange images in one row. 
- I displayed grid system for the divide the different sections on the main part

I also displayed grid system for divide the different sections in this page

**Day 3**

I started coding with HTML and CSS for page1 

**Day 4**

I finished HTML and CSS for page 1 and I started page 2

**Day 5**

I did the page for version of mobile and tablet with MediaQueries.
I changed the maquette of mobile and tablet (v2) because the image of v1 is too small (I placed 2 images in one row for mobile version and 3 images for tablet in one row for v1). After I changed into 1 image in a row for the mobile and 2 images in a row for tablet version 
I changed the size of text and the size of image that is automatically suitable for each version. 
I update the readme file

**Conclusion**

Done: Action 1

Not Yet: Action 2, Action 3
